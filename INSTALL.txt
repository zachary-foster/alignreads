Installation Instructions:

1) Download the most recent release of alignreads on GitHub (alignreads-XXXXXXXX.tar.gz).
2) Uncompress the folder using:
	"tar -xf alignreads-XXXXXXXX.tar.gz"
3) Change directories so that you are in the newly uncompressed folder. 
4) Run the installation script:
	"python install.py /path/to/install/location"
The install script has many options to adapt to different situations.
It will attempt to download and install all prerequisites (except biopython). 
Using command line options to install.py, you can tell it where an already 
installed prerequisite exists or have it look for it in your $PATH.

If the automated installation fails (typically due to non-standard system 
configurations), you might have to install the prerequisite yourself. If this 
is the case, install the prerequisite  that the installer failed to install and 
then rerun the installer with the `--overwrite` option to overwrite the partial 
installation and tell the installer where the newly installed prerequisite is.

NOTE: Alignreads requires Biopython for parsing of YASRA output. This is a 
python module that is not automatically installed. If you do not already have 
Biopython installed, you should install it or the Anaconda environment,
which includes Biopython.
